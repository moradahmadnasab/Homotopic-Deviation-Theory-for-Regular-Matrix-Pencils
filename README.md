## ðŸ”Ž Overview  
We generalize the **homotopic deviation theory** from square complex matrices to **regular matrix pencils**  
\[
P(\lambda) = A - \lambda B.
\]  

Key aspects include:  
- Studying the **existence and analyticity of the resolvent** of deviated matrix pencils  
  \[
  P(\lambda,t) = (A+t\Delta A) - \lambda (B+t\Delta B),
  \]
  with $t \in \hat{\mathbb{C}}$.  
- Investigating the **limits of the resolvent and the spectrum** as $|t| \to \infty$.  
- Analyzing **special cases** when $t$ approaches eigenvalues of related matrix pairs.  
- Exploring how **Weierstrass structure** changes under different assumptions on the role of $\lambda$ and $t$.  
- Validating results with **numerical examples**.

## âœ¨ Key Contributions  
- Extends homotopic deviation theory to **regular matrix pencils**.  
- Introduces refined notions of **frontier points, critical points, and limit points**.  
- Connects the deviation parameter $t$ with eigenvalues $\lambda(t)$ in the extended complex plane.  
- Provides insights for **parametric polynomial eigenvalue problems** and their linearizations.
